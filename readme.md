# SysInternals Training 

## A quick guide to teach team mates in a 45 minute session how to install Sysmon from a basic config and capture and export events using Procmon. 

### Big shout out to @ABertram for his published work on [AdamTheAutomator](https://adamtheautomator.com/procmon/). 
Check out his post for info on some of Procmon's more advanced features and find my Sysmon config borrowed heavily (*read entirely*) from @SwiftOnSecurity and their pending pull-requests [here](https://www.github.com/iaintshootinmis/sysmon-config).
